# 🚀 NestJS Learning Journey

Welcome to my NestJS learning repository! This space is dedicated to understanding the fundamentals of **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, and **backend development**. The mission? To go from beginner to builder—one module at a time. 🛠️

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Grasp the **core concepts** of NestJS.
- Learn TypeScript with real-world backend context.
- Build small, functional backend applications.
- Practice CRUD, authentication, and API design.

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Areas

### 🔩 Core Concepts

- Learn about **Modules**, **Controllers**, and **Services**.
- Understand **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Decorators**.
- Implement **Basic Routing** and request handling logic.

### 🧾 TypeScript Basics

- Work with **Interfaces**, **Types**, **Enums**, and **Classes**.
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.

### 🌐 Building APIs

- Create REST APIs using:
  - `@Controller`
  - `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, `@Delete()`
- Use **DTOs** to handle request payloads with:
  - `@Body`
  - `@Param`

### ✅ Validation

- Integrate:
  - [`class-validator`](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator)
  - [`class-transformer`](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer)
- Enforce data validation in request bodies.

### 🗃️ Database Integration

- Choose one:
  - **TypeORM**
  - **Prisma**
  - **Mongoose**
- Connect and interact with a database.
- Learn to model and manage entities/schemas.

## 🛠️ Practice & Projects

### 📝 Todo API
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Learn RESTful routing and services

### 🔐 Basic Auth API
- Simple **User Registration/Login**
- JWT-based Authentication
- Protected routes with guards

### 📰 Blog API
- Nested Resources:
  - Posts → Comments
- Demonstrates relational data handling

## 📚 Bonus Tips

- Commit often, and comment your code clearly 🧠
- Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test your endpoints
- Write clean, modular code
- Practice reading NestJS documentation — it's gold! ✨
